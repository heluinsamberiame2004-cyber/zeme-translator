GENESIS 1 NOTES
==================================================

## 1. Heaven Terminology

ting = physical sky / created heavens  
tinggim = spiritual heaven / dwelling of God  

Decision:
Genesis 1 uses "ting" for created heavens.
Reserve "tinggim" for spiritual or divine heaven contexts.

---

## 2. Earth and Ground

kedei = earth / land / ground  

Decision:
Use "kedei" consistently for physical earth.
Avoid unnecessary alternate forms unless context requires distinction.

---

## 3. Image and Likeness (Genesis 1:26)

luî = image  
’nzuâsiak = likeness  

Decision:
Keep both terms distinct.
Do not merge them into one meaning.
Maintain dual expression as in source text.

---

## 4. Dominion and Subdue

rezie = rule / dominion  

Decision:
Use same lexical root for dominion/subdue where structure matches,
unless later context requires stronger force nuance.

---

## 5. Good

yi = good  

Decision:
Use "yi" consistently for creation goodness.
Do not replace with moral-good alternatives unless context demands.

==================================================
GENESIS 2 NOTES
==================================================

## 6. Sanctify (Genesis 2:3)

tew’nchi = sanctify / make holy  

Decision:
Use this term only for divine setting-apart action.
Do not generalize for human holiness unless context supports it.

---

## 7. Host of Heaven

pelung = host / army  

Decision:
"ting pelung" used as phrase for host of heaven.
Do not store full clause forms in dictionary.

---

## 8. Tree Terminology

keringbe chingbang = tree of life  
keyi-kesia-chibe chingbang = tree of knowledge  

Decision:
Keep as fixed theological phrases.
Do not shorten unless context clearly allows.

---

## 9. Knowledge

keyi-kesia = knowledge  

Decision:
Maintain abstract meaning.
Avoid confusing with simple "know" verb (chî).

---

## 10. One Flesh (Genesis 2:24)

pum kat = one body / unified flesh  

Decision:
Keep literal physical-marriage meaning.
Do not automatically interpret as covenant theology.

## 11. Helper Suitable

kebuibe kau = helper  
hang kebuibe = suitable  

Decision:

Avoid hierarchical interpretation unless context demands.

==================================================
GENESIS 3 NOTES
==================================================

## 12. Evil Terminology

hemui = sin / moral corruption  
kemuîbe = bad / harmful / opposite of good  

Decision:
Genesis 3 uses "kemuîbe" in knowledge contrast.
Reserve "hemui" for developed sin theology.

---

## 13. Serpent (Genesis 3:1)

henêu = serpent  
ningching sia = crafty  

Decision:
Translate literally as serpent.
Theological identification (Satan) belongs in commentary, not lexicon.

---

Use only when divine judgment is pronounced.
Do not use casually for general suffering.

---

---

## 16. Cherubim and Flaming Sword

kerubme = cherubim  
hemitaube hiazutkie = flaming sword  

Decision:
Keep transliteration for cherubim.
Avoid simplifying theological imagery.

==================================================
GENERAL TRANSLATION PRINCIPLES
==================================================

1. Dictionary contains only lexical roots.
2. Grammar markers (de lei, gai, lu, kat, kau) are not dictionary entries.
3. Avoid storing full sentences in dictionary.
4. Maintain consistency across chapters.
5. Record lexical conflicts immediately in this file.
6. Separate theology from lexicon.
7. Do not change established terms without documentation here.
